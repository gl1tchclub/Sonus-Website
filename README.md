## Purpose

Sonus is a music web service that offers access to millions of songs. Sonus is a more personal platform where each user, as they listen and develop their music taste, can see their own unique, individually crafted Sona, a musical persona.

Each Sona is developed using an AI that takes in user data such as favourite songs, genres, artists, those they don't like, their playlists, vibe, mood, how often they listen to music, and more!

## Installing the Mimi Shrine
To run the ARC locally, you first need to have:
* Git Bash
* Node
* An IDE that can run HTML, CSS, and Javascript ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) recommended)

Once you have the necessary software installed, clone down and open the folder in your IDE. Also download the svelte extension for better code readability.

If using VSCode, open a new terminal and type the following commands:

```bash
npm i
npm run open
```

It is also recommended that you install the svelte extension available on VSCode for improved readability.
