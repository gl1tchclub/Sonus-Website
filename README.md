## Purpose

Sonus is a music web service that offers access to millions of songs. Sonus is a more personal platform where each user, as they listen and develop their music taste, can see their own unique, individually crafted Sona, a musical persona.

The idea is that each Sona is developed using an AI program that takes in user data such as favourite songs, genres, artists, those they don't like, their playlists, vibe, mood, how often they listen to music, and more to generate their Sona!

## Project Description


### What does the Website Do?

Sonus is a web-based music service that provides its users access to millions of songs, artists, and playlists. Additionally, using AI, a Sona is uniquely crafted for each user depending on their listening habits.

A Sona can look soft and glowy like an aura, or clear and spikey. 

Each Sona will have a description explaining the look of it. 

Is it chaotic, yet soft? 

Is it rough and textured, but also elegant? 

Each user's Sona develops over time the more they listen to music. A Sona may look bright and watery today, but could change completely the next.

Sonas are like clouds in the sky - they're shaped based on their environment and look unique to everyone!

Users can connect with others through their Sonas! Often times, people are very conservative with their music tastes, worrying that others may dislike it. This can lead to being embarrassed and feeling shame about their unique tastes.

Comparing your Sonas with friends and family, seeing the similarities and differences, and having more open dialogues about how different tastes in music can look visually will hopefully lead to more positivity around the different types of music others listen to.

### Technology Usage
To make this project come true, I used VSCode as the IDE and Sveltekit as the framework. Using this framework, I coded the entire project in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

All user data and images is fetched from the [Unsplash API](https://api.unsplash.com/) and the sona description is fetched from the [WordNinjas API.](https://api.api-ninjas.com/)

### Known Bugs

### Challenges
//making this while learning HTML, JS, and CSS in svelte from scratch
//scope creep
//apis
//making aniamted components using code framework others developed -- learning what they coded

### Future Features

___

## Installing Sonus
To run the ARC locally, you first need to have:
* Git Bash
* Node
* An IDE that can run HTML, CSS, and Javascript. ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended

Once you have the necessary software installed, clone down and open the folder in your IDE. Also download the svelte extension for better code readability.

If using VSCode, open a new terminal and type the following script:
```bash
npm run start
```
OR the following commands:
```bash
npm i
npm run dev -- --open
```
