## Installing the Mimi Shrine
To run the ARC locally, you first need to have:
* Git Bash
* Node
* An IDE that can run HTML, CSS, and Javascript ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) recommended)

Once you have the necessary software installed, clone down and open the folder in your IDE. Also download the svelte extension for better code readability.

If using VSCode, open a new terminal and type the following commands:

```bash
npm i
npm run open
```

It is also recommended that you install the svelte extension available on VSCode for improved readability.
