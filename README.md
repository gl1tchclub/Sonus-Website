## Purpose

Sonus is a music web service that offers access to millions of songs. Sonus is a more personal platform where each user, as they listen and develop their music taste, can see their own unique, individually crafted Sona, a musical persona.

The idea is that each Sona is developed using an AI program that takes in user data such as favourite songs, genres, artists, those they don't like, their playlists, vibe, mood, how often they listen to music, and more to generate their Sona!

**A million songs, one Sona**

## Project Description
To make this project come true, I used VSCode as the IDE and Sveltekit as the framework. Using this framework, the entire project was coded just using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

All user data and images is fetched from the [Unsplash API](https://api.unsplash.com/) and the sona description is fetched from the [WordNinjas API.](https://api.api-ninjas.com/)

### What does the Website Do?

Sonus is a web-based music service that provides its users access to millions of songs, artists, and playlists. Using AI, a Sona is uniquely crafted for each user depending on their listening habits.


### Technology Usage
//apis and AI images, frameworks, languages

### Known Bugs

### Challenges
//making this while learning HTML, JS, and CSS in svelte from scratch
//scope creep
//apis
//making aniamted components using code framework others developed -- learning what they coded

### Future Features

## Installing the Mimi Shrine
To run the ARC locally, you first need to have:
* Git Bash
* Node
* An IDE that can run HTML, CSS, and Javascript ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) recommended)

Once you have the necessary software installed, clone down and open the folder in your IDE. Also download the svelte extension for better code readability.

If using VSCode, open a new terminal and type the following commands:

```bash
npm i
npm run open
```

It is also recommended that you install the svelte extension available on VSCode for improved readability.
